# Project: Visitor

## 1. Vision

'Visitor' is not a product; it is a sketchbook, an exploratory practice. It is a collection of software "lenses" designed to make invisible, abstract processes tangible and beautiful. Each "sketch" in this project is an attempt to observe and represent the hidden choreography in the systems around us, from the mathematical to the biological to the digital.

This project rejects the idea of technology as a mere tool for productivity. Instead, it embraces technology as a medium for philosophical inquiry and artistic expression. It is a search for the inherent meaning, structure, and beauty in complex systems.

## 2. The First Sketch: A Study of Emergent Behavior

Our first sketch is an implementation of the "Boids" algorithm, a classic artificial life simulation created by Craig Reynolds. 

We will create a system of simple, autonomous agents ("boids") that adhere to a few basic rules. From these simple rules, a complex, life-like, and unpredictable flocking behavior emerges. This sketch was chosen as it perfectly embodies the core theme of the project: discovering how profound complexity can arise from simple, mechanical foundations.

## 3. Engineering & Documentation Standards

This project will be executed with the highest possible standard of engineering and documentation.
- **Code:** All code will be clean, well-structured, and commented to explain the *'why'* behind the implementation, not just the *'what'*.
- **Documentation:** The `docs` directory will contain detailed essays and technical explanations for each sketch. 
- **Commits & Updates:** Each step of the development process will be clearly and explicitly described.

## 4. Project Structure

- `/sketches`: Contains the source code and documentation for each sketch.
  - Each sketch folder (e.g., `/sketches/01-emergence`) is a self-contained unit including its `sketch.js` (logic), `index.html` (view), and `README.md` (documentation).
- `index.html`: The main gallery page listing all sketches.
- `README.md`: This file. The high-level overview of the project.
